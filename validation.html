    Input fields have the following states:

    $untouched The field has not been touched yet
    $touched The field has been touched
    $pristine The field has not been modified yet
    $dirty The field has been modified
    $invalid The field content is not valid
    $valid The field content is valid

    They are all properties of the input field, and are either true or false.

    Forms have the following states:

    $pristine No fields have been modified yet
    $dirty One or more have been modified
    $invalid The form content is not valid
    $valid The form content is valid
    $submitted The form is submitted

    They are all properties of the form, and are either true or false.
    
    -->
    <form name="myForm">
        <input name="myInput" ng-model="myInput" required>
    </form>
      
    <p>The input's valid state is:</p>
    <h1>{{myForm.myInput.$valid}}</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Try writing an E-mail address in the input field:</p>

    <form name="myForm">
        <input type="email" name="myInput" ng-model="myInput">
    </form>

    <p>The input's valid state is:</p>
    <h1>{{myForm.myInput.$valid}}</h1>
    <p>Note that the state of the input field is "true" before you start writing in it, even if it does not contain an e-mail address.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Try leaving the first input field blank:</p>

    <form name="myForm">
        <p>Name:
            <input name="myName" ng-model="myName" required>
            <span ng-show="myForm.myName.$touched && myForm.myName.$invalid">The name is required.</span>
        </p>

        <p>Address:
            <input name="myAddress" ng-model="myAddress" required>
        </p>

    </form>

    <p>We use the ng-show directive to only show the error message if the field has been touched AND is empty.</p>
